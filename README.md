# Snap to road Challenge (AngularJs)

Your task is to use the Google Maps Road API [Snap to Roads](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/roads/snap) feature to display trip on Google Maps that fits smoothly to roads. 

Below is an example of a trip that does not fit smoothly into roads:

![Alt text](maps/raw_data_mapped.png?raw=true "Raw trip data drawn")

Below is the same trip that has been fitted to roads:

![Alt text](maps/latlng_snapped_to_road.png?raw=true "Trips fitted to road")

You should make a website that accepts lat-lng data points as raw input and display the two versions of the trip side-by-side.

You can use the data in [test_data](test_data) to test your code.

BONUS: if you can think of a way to reduce the number of http request to Google Maps Road API for longer trip.
